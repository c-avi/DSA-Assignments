This repository contains Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) assignments.
<br>
Question - 04
<br>
Write a C++ program that performs various operations on an array, including reversal, checking if the array is sorted, and finding the maximum and minimum elements. The program should:
<br>
Initialize an array of a fixed size (e.g., 10) and allow the user to populate it with integer values.
<br>
Implement the following functionalities:
<br>
Reverse the array and display the reversed array.
<br>
Check if the array is sorted in ascending order and display an appropriate message.
<br>
Find and display the maximum and minimum elements in the array.
<br>
Allow the user to display the original array at any point.
<br>
Question - 05
<br>
Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of the digits of a given positive integer.
<br>
Input:
<br>
Enter a positive integer: 12345
<br>
Output:
<br>
The sum of the digits of 12345 is 15.
<br>
Question - 06
<br>
Write a recursive function to determine if a given natural number
<br>
N is a palindrome. A number is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
<br>
Input: 121
<br>
Output: true
<br>
Question - 07
<br>
You are given a rod of length N and an array prices[] where prices[i] represents the price of a rod of length i+1. Your task is to determine the maximum profit you can achieve by cutting the rod into smaller lengths and selling the pieces.
<br>
Write a recursive function maxProfit(int n, int[] prices) to calculate the maximum profit.
<br>
Input: N = 8
<br>
prices = [1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20]
<br>
Output: 22
<br>
Question - 08
<br>
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem that involves moving disks from one rod to another under certain constraints. There are three rods: source rod (A), destination rod (C), and auxiliary rod (B). The objective is to move N disks from rod A to rod C, following these rules:
<br>
Only one disk can be moved at a time.
<br>
A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or on an empty rod.
<br>
Use the auxiliary rod (B) as needed.
<br>
Write a recursive function towerOfHanoi(int n, char source, char destination, char auxiliary) to print the sequence of moves required to solve the problem.
<br>
Input: N = 2
<br>
Output: Move disk 1 from A to B
<br>
Move disk 2 from A to C
<br>
Move disk 1 from B to C
<br>
